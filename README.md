# Jarvis — Mac Login Assistant

A lightweight, voice-based briefing assistant for macOS. On every login, Jarvis speaks a personalized briefing covering your greeting, RAM pressure, current time zones, and weather with air quality.

No Electron. No menu bar bloat. One Python process that runs, speaks, and exits.

---

## What It Says

On each login (after a 10-second delay to let the desktop load):

> *"Hello Arpan, good morning. RAM pressure is normal. The current Central time is 8:45 AM, and 9:45 AM Eastern. Currently in Chicago it's 62 degrees Fahrenheit, partly cloudy, and feels like 59. Air quality is good."*

## Requirements

- macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- Python 3.9 or later (`python3 --version` to check)
- A free [OpenWeatherMap API key](https://openweathermap.org/api) (takes ~2 minutes to get)

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone / navigate to the project

```bash
cd /path/to/jarvis
```

### 2. Add your OpenWeatherMap API key

Sign up free at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api), then copy `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual key:

```
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=abc123yourkeyhere
```

### 3. Personalize `config.yaml`

```yaml
user:
  name: "Arpan"          # Your name for the greeting

voice:
  rate: 175              # Speaking speed (words per minute)
  voice: "Samantha"      # Run `say -v ?` in Terminal to see all available voices

weather:
  city: "Chicago"        # Your city
  country_code: "US"
  units: "imperial"      # imperial = °F  |  metric = °C
```

### 4. Run setup

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Create a Python virtual environment in `.venv/`
- Install all dependencies
- Register a **Login Agent** so Jarvis runs automatically on every login

### 5. Test it immediately

```bash
.venv/bin/python run.py
```

You should hear your full briefing spoken aloud.

## Toggling Features On/Off

Edit `config.yaml` — set any module to `false` to silence it:

```yaml
modules:
  greeting: true
  ram: true
  time: true
  weather: false    # <-- turns off weather without touching any code
```

No restart needed for the next login.

---

## Changing the Voice

Run this in Terminal to hear all available voices:

```bash
say -v ? | grep en_
```

Then update `config.yaml`:

```yaml
voice:
  voice: "Alex"     # or "Daniel", "Karen", "Moira", etc.
```

---

## Viewing Logs

If something sounds wrong or goes silent, check the logs:

```bash
# Recent output
cat logs/jarvis.log

# Errors (e.g. bad API key, network issue)
cat logs/jarvis_error.log
```

---

## Uninstalling

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jarvis.assistant.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jarvis.assistant.plist
```

The project folder and `.venv` can then be deleted manually.

---

## Adding New Features

Each feature is a self-contained module:

1. Create a folder under `modules/` (e.g. `modules/calendar/`)
2. Add an `__init__.py` and your logic file
3. Return a plain string meant to be spoken
4. Import and call it in `run.py`
5. Add a toggle for it in `config.yaml` under `modules:`

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| No sound on login | Check `logs/jarvis_error.log` for Python errors |
| Wrong city weather | Verify `city` + `country_code` in `config.yaml` |
| `API key invalid` error | Check your `.env` file has the correct key |
| Voice not found | Run `say -v ?` and use an exact name from the list |
| Runs too early (desktop not ready) | The plist has a 10s delay — increase `ThrottleInterval` if needed |
